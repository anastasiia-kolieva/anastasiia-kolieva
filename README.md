I do practical homework on each topic every week. I use Visual Studio Code and Webpack. The results can be viewed on my GitHub Page.

At July 2020 I have graduated from studying HTML+CSS.
Took part in a team project on the creating the site of a teacher of English language. I was lucky to be in the role of Scrum master at the team.

At November 2020 I have graduated from studing Java Script.
Took part in a team project on the creating media resource of different films (Filmoteka). Created input for searching films, correct HTTP-request and pagination.

With the solution of each task assigned to me, I am more and more aware that I enjoy the work done. This encourages me not to stop and go further, further comprehend web development.</p>
