The last project I took part in was a SaaS solution for simplifying subscription and enrollment processes, offering a comprehensive platform for digitizing onboarding and customer enrollment workflows. It's designed to be multilingual and accessible via the internet, eliminating the need for on-premises installations. Robust security measures, including encryption and access controls, ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

Also, I was involved in 2 big projects to build a website for a web hosting company. The projects were led by me at all stages (layout, creation of functionality, connection to the backend, bug fixing, preparation for release, small changes at the request of the client). In one of these 2 projects, I completely changed the initial structure, that means that, initially the project was with a certain structure of pages and components, after adjustments from the client, it was necessary to change the structure almost completely.

Another project â€“ was a website for a grocery company. Where I had to carry out improvements and bug fixings for existing projects, those in which I did not participate initially. I have added a new part of a website (pages of partner companies, product pages, pages with recipes). According to the provided task and design, I fully completed the creation of new pages, logical functionality, and
appropriate backend. I carried out bug fixing.

Also, one of projects that I have built â€“ was a web application for tracking loss / increase of human body weight. I was involved in it from start to the end, from layout creation stage until full project release. I was adding necessary functionality and appropriate backend.

I graduated from the course:books: Fullstack Web Developer course from GOIT and within a short period of time I received a job offer.
